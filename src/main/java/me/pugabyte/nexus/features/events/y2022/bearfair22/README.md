Ideas:

- Summer Camp Theme:
    - Remove the carnival tents and make it more like a camp feel, more woodsy i guess
    - Move theme park rides onto its own themepark themed island, replacing SDU Island
    - Would have to do something with the market place / merchants
    - What to do with rollercoaster?
- Keep Fair Theme:
    - Replace SDU island w/ a Pride Island

Improvements that need to be made from last year:

- **Event needs to end before or on the 1th of July** *for 2022*
- More puzzles for Quests & Minigames, and less scav hunts
    - Make these puzzles easily understood on what needs to be done
- Replace Fairground Minigames:
    - Seeker: too hard, and not fun
    - Frogger: has appeared twice, keep if no new ideas minigames
    - Archery: same as above
- Trees/Woodcutting:
    - On break a tree, place a sapling, and allow the palyer to force grow the tree using bonemeal
- Quest Items:
    - Lore that is more helpful and matches other uses for items, like sellcrates or recycler
        - Ex: [SellCrate] Fishing Items --> [SellCrate] FishingLoot
    - ItemBuilder#questItem
        - undroppable
        - untrashable
        - unstoraable
        - untradeable
- Random flowers feature:
    - If planned to be used again:
        - increase the rate of flowers that are used in quests
        - decrease the rate of wither rose, because it's a rare flower
- Clientside Content Appearing:
    - Other than just popping into existance:
        - Particles could spawn before appearing, but this would need to be limited, could be laggy
        - Have an NPC walk to the area, and then it appears, as if they were setting it up.
        - Player walks to the area, and then it appears, as if they were setting it up themselves.
- More custom ride models
- Tournaments:
    - Only allow users to pick times during the first few days of the event, instead of during the whole thing.
        - prevents people choosing the last days of the event only
        - gives hosters more time to actually do the tournament
        - matches past the selected times could easily be planned by those playing, because there will be many less
          competitors
- NPC script cooldown waits
    - Make the cooldown before talking to another NPC the length of the NPCs script which you are currently talking to,
      plus a little bit
- NPC Merchant Menus:
    - Only show the menu to the player if the player is still near the NPC
- Add more easter eggs or random useless features/builds
- When giving a player a kit, place the items in the players hotbar, moving any items currently occupying those slots
  into their inventory
